- ✅ Decorative elements properly marked with `aria-hidden`

**Keyboard Navigation**
- ✅ Full keyboard support (Arrow keys, Home/End, Tab, Enter/Space)
- ✅ Proper focus management and tab order
- ✅ Visible focus indicators with CSS focus-visible
- ✅ Cross-group navigation in sidebar
- ✅ Focus trapping and management

**Color & Contrast**
- ✅ OKLCH color space for better accessibility
- ✅ 4.5:1 minimum contrast ratios
- ✅ Dark mode support with proper contrast
- ✅ Color not used as sole indicator of information

### 📊 **Performance & Monitoring**
